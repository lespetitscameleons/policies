# EXPENSE POLICY

### What are Expenses?

The expenses are defined as money spent or cost incurred in an organisation's efforts to conduct a business. Expenses may be in the form of actual cash payments (such as honouring contracts), a computed expired portion (depreciation) of an asset, or an amount taken out of earnings (such as bad debts). 

For the association certain expenses are automatic and will not require punctual validations (ex. rent for the building and payment for the teachers). Usually these expenses have been approved during, or concur from, decisions made in meetings from the charity Trustees. 

Some other expenses will require validations outside of trustees meetings. In these cases a validation by the trustees will be required prior to making any payment for the charity. 

Any member of the association can make expenses for the charity provided the expenses were validated by the appropriate number of trustees.

**_Not following the rules to authorise expenses may lead to:_**

* **_the refusal of repayment of the unauthorised expenses_**
* **_the repayment of the expense to the charity by the member if the payment has been done using the charity provisions._**

### Authorisation & Justification of Expenses

Step 1: Approval prior to purchase

All expenses have to be approved either during a committee meeting or via e-mail.

The validation of the expense will be obtained in written form by sending an email to [lespetitscameleons@gmail.com](mailto:lespetitscameleons@gmail.com) and all the trustees (at least it must be send to the quorum of trustees) and logged in the Expense Log.

It is particularly important to validate the expense before any payment is made directly by a member with the intention to be reimbursed.

The levels of validation are as follow:

* For any purchase **below** or **equal** to **£50** it requires the validation of **one trustee**. 
* For any purchase **above £50** it requires the validation of **two trustees**.

Here are typical reasons of expenses done in the name of the charity:

* Purchase of consumable for the lessons (notebooks, paper, pencils, paint, etc.)
* Purchase of pedagogic material (like books, game, dictionaries, etc.)
* Investment in assets (like storage furniture, tablets, etc.)  
* Travel to training places 
* Training fees if the training has been requested by the charity
* Insurances

This list is not binding and other expenses might be done in the name of the charity as long as they get validated prior to any payment.

In order to minimize the burden of seeking authorisation, authorisation may be granted in advance for specific activities. The committee will define budgets for:

* Half-term club
* Consumables
* Photocopy (up to 5 photocopy per pupil per session at 10p per page)

### Procedure to Repay Expenses

Step 2: Logging / Done by a committee member

Log the expense in the spreadsheet ("Notes de Frais") to register the purchase. The request specifics and justification under the blue bar at the end of the spreadsheet.

Step 3: Providing an invoice  / receipt to prove the purchase’s amount

The purchaser will provide the invoice or receipt to a committee member who will store it and move the record above the blue bar.

This will be recorded by adding YES in the "JUSTIFICATIONS RECUES" Column.

Step 4: Checking and repayment by the treasurer

The treasurer will check that:

* the items purchased are as agreed
* the amount matches the purchaser’s request. 

Payment will be processed by the treasurer by bank transfer and confirmed by adding YES in the Paid Column.
